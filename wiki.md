# Introduction
Skred Red is a name for a "Big Red" [Magic: the Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) deck that is played in the [Modern format](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/modern). Like most big red decks, Skred Red generally plays the following:

 - Efficient removal in [Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=122120), [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397722), [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373604), and others.  
 - Resource denial in [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370419) or [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=46000).  
 - Game-ending threats such as [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373679), [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=266362), and [Pia and Kiran Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=398453).  
  
This primer is an effort by the subscribers of /r/SkredRed to help aid Magic players in the construction and play of a modern Skred Red deck.

#  Why You Should Play Skred Red:
-  It is a great deck for a known metagame, especially in a metagame were aggressive strategies like Dredge, Infect, and Affinity are prevalent.
-  It is a mono-red deck that is not an aggro deck.
-  The deck has a forward play style that also forces intricate decisions for optimal play.
-  It is not a dedicated burn deck (our Bolts generally hit creatures more than players).
-  It is very budget-friendly (the standard manabase costs no more than $60, the core of most builds cost roughly $80-$100) outside of Blood Moon (which can be substituted).
-  It is not a dedicated prison deck.

#  Why You Should Not Play Skred Red:
-  The deck has a weak combo matchup and has trouble playing an early threat.
-  Mono-red has no easy removal for enchantments in the Modern format.
-  Game 1 matchups against mono-colored decks can sometimes be awkward.
-  If you are not certain on how to approach a matchup, a mistake can potentially be very costly.
-  If all you want to do is lock your opponent out of a game with Blood Moon. [There's a separate primer for that.](https://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/established-modern/control/663335-pyro-prison-goblin-mono-red-control-the-sideboard)

# Card Choices
These are not comprehensive lists since the Skred shell is extremely flexible, however these are cards that have been proven to work or have a high amount of potential to them.

## Lands
These are needed for casting spells, obviously, but the defining aspect of Skred Red is the Snow-Covered mana base, used primarily for the deck's namesake card, Skred, and secondarily for the advantage provided by Scrying Sheets.

  - [Snow-Covered Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=121233): The most important land in the deck, this card enables Skred, the deck's most powerful mid- to late-game removal spell.
  - [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=121204): The most powerful card from [Coldsnap](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Coldsnap), Scrying Sheets is a [card advantage](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Card_advantage) engine that improves draw steps by removing lands from the top of the library.
  - [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=190400): While this land does nothing under Blood Moon it can serve as a late-game win condition as it can provide a free lightning bolt every time you play a mountain. However due to the speed that we get it online (turn 7 at the soonest) it's not a popular choice, nor should you ever play it as more than a 1 of.
  - [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=278058): There are some tribal builds of Skred this card can be played in, however due to the land requirements of Skred itself it is recommended to never run more than two.
  - [Mouth of Ronom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=121234): Late-game uncounterable removal that can hit creatures with protection from red.

## Threats/Win Conditions
Threats in Skred can vary in number depending on the build, but they all share common traits of either not dying to common removal, producing a lot of value by removing creatures, creating more card advantage, or both.

  -  [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=266362): Koth of the Hammer in the correct shell is easily one of the most powerful planeswalkers in the game. His -5 activates after only two turns of being on the field, given protection, and it will win the game a majority of the time. His +1 applies a lot of pressure against creature-lite boards. Both his first and second modes can be used to produce mana when necessary.
  -  [Boros Reckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366385): The once-staple creature in Skred, this minotaur wizard is a dominant force on the ground than can block and directly trade with most creatures (the only creature that come out on top against him need four or more toughness than their own power - uncommon in Modern). There are several synergies with Boros Reckoner, typically with board wipes and Skred itself. It is, however, very vulnerable to popular removal in the current metagame, and for that reason it has fallen out of favor in lieu of the more durable Eternal Scourge.
  -  [Eternal Scourge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=414296): An unusual card that seems bad on its face, Eternal Scourge is actually a card that fills several important roles in Skred. It is not permanently answered by spot removal and blocks an active [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397710), as well as other protection from red creatures, very well. Its synergy with Relic of Progenitus makes it a nigh-unkillable threat. It is, however, very mana-intensive, so it is no recommended to run a full four.
  -  [Squee, the Immortal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=443034): An alternative to Eternal Scourge that comes with its own upsides and downsides. On the pros, Squee had no reliance on Relic of Progenitus to return from the graveyard, and without Scourge's exile clause Squee is a nicer target for opponent's Path to Exiles and Fatal Pushes. Conversely, Squee packs less power and toughness, and he cannot block troublesome protection from red creatures.
  -  [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383258): When not answered, this card is a three-turn clock that is great against combo decks like [Storm](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-ur-storm-8960#online), [Ad Nauseum](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-ad-nauseam-26328#online), and removal-light builds of [Scapeshift](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-scapeshift-20402#online). If it goes unanswered, it becomes more and more difficult for control to deal with as well.
  -  [Pia and Kiran Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=398453): This card does several useful things. It creates multiple bodies for resilience against spot removal, and these bodies do a decent job at blocking wide assaults and slowing down large creatures. Its activated ability is reach and removal, and makes good use of late-game mana rocks and Relics.
  -  [Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=426838): It is easy to drop to one card and let Hazoret do her work. She is a great offensive threat with five power, haste, and a direct damage ability. In a pinch, she is also a powerful blocker, boasting virtually infinite toughness thanks to indestructible. She is weak to Path, but strong against black and red removal, so she serves as a good foil to Koth or Stormbreath.
  -  [Karn, Scion of Urza](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=442889): If you are interested in drawing cards, either Chandra (Torch of Defiance or Pyromaster) will provide more controllable and beneficial card draw than Karn. However, Karn can find a home in artifact-heavy builds, where he comes down and produces a decent blocker on turns three or four, then proceeds to back that play up by producing minor card advantage or further threats the following turns.
  -  [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394730): Run primarily in a dragon-oriented build with Stormbreath/Thundermaw and Cavern of Souls, but generally not on its own because getting a Bolt in exchange for the opponent removing the Regent is not enough value recouped.
  -  [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373679): Not only is this a five-mana hasty flier, it has protection from white and can use Monstrosity to make him both a mid-game threat and a late-game finisher. Stormbreath excels at closing out games due to his evasion, and the only decks in the meta capable of removing 1-for-1 it are generally decks playing black removal cards. It's 4/4 body also makes for a good blocker from time to time.
  -  [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233055): Hard to answer, a resolved Batterskull can almost single-handedly take over a game if left unchecked. Slower to win than Wurmcoil Engine, but it comes down a turn earlier and isn't completely blanked by Path to Exile.
  -  [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=426836): Glorybringer is a dual threat/removal spell that brings a surprising amount to the table is a variety of matchups. Its strengths come to the forefront against midrange, where it can two- or three-for-one the opponent while smashing for damage. Against creature-based aggressive decks, he kills creatures or blocks with reasonable bulk. Against control, he provides a hasty threat that can assassinate planeswalkers and demand an answer.
  -  [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=389756): Normally this card is at the top of the curve and is a little slow to get out, but if it makes it to the battlefield it will usually take over the game with the value it provides. Just be wary of Path to Exile.
  -  [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=417683): This card plays several roles on account of its multitude of abilities, but it will primarily serve as a way to produce card advantage with its first +1. It can also be used to ramp in to more/bigger threats, remove a problem creature, or -7 into a controlled board state to finish the game. Note that the spell flipped from the first ability must be cast immediately, so play a land before activating. The +1 is also good synergy with Eternal Scourge.

## Single Target Removal
Removal is the bread-and-butter of a control deck. It interrupts the opponent's plans, slowing them down enough for the threats of Skred Red to finish the game.

  -  [Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=122120): The namesake card of the deck and the number one reason the deck runs its unique snow-heavy mana base. This card effectively does as much damage as the number of lands you have on the field at instant speed for only a single red mana. In the early game, save Skreds over Bolts if you expect larger threats later on.  
  -  [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397722): This card is the single most played card in Modern and one of the biggest reasons many control and midrange decks play red. For one mana, this card can deal with about [4,000](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?sort=cmc+&output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&tough=%20%3C=[3]&type=%20[%22Creature%22]&format=%20[%22Modern%22]&text=%20![shroud]%20![indestructible]%20![%22protection%20from%20red%22]%20![%22protection%20from%20all%20colors%22]%20![%22protection%20from%20instants%22]) creatures or apply three damage to an opponent's life total, which adds up with Koths, Pia and Kirans, Stormbreaths, the opponent's own fetch- and shocklands, et cetera.  In less aggressive Skred builds, the potential of this card is not maximized, but its universal power and utility are undeniable.  
  -  [Roast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394667): This card really only sees play as an answer to early game, high toughness creatures. While not optimal, many pilots feel it is a bit necessary.
  -  [Mizzium Mortars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=405302): Its most immediate purpose is the same as Roast, but without the targeting nonflying restriction, and a point less of damage which means it misses Siege Rhino and larger Tarmogoyfs. Unlike Roast however, this card can provide a late game board sweeper on the opponent.
  -  [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397830): Efficiently deals with large threats and pro-red creatures, but suffers greatly against aggro matchups since most Skred lists don't have access to black mana.
  -  [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370512): This is used largely as a utility artifact, but it is a great answer to cards like [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397710), [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373536), and [Kor Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194708). It's not unusual to see a Skred list play 1 or 2 in the main deck if these cards are popular.
  -  [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=393853): Used in some lists as yet another card to help filter draws in an efficient manner, while also taking care of a creature or dealing some damage. It works nicely in concert with Scrying Sheets and Chandra.
  -  [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370623): One of the few ways mono-red can answer an enchantment. This card is slow but extremely versatile, and given the right setup can even double as a sweeper (do not mistake it for one though, as it is generally better used to one-for-one against resilient threats).

## Sweepers
What is a control deck without its mass removal? Sweepers are incredibly important for Skred Red, as they allow the deck to stabilize and produce card advantage against aggressive decks.

  -  [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373365): This is one of the many efficient sweepers available to the deck. It is a turn 2 answer to decks that like to go wide with small creatures like [Affinity](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-affinity-8972#online). This card is normally the default sweeper choice for builds playing Boros Reckoner.
  -  [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373604): Likely the best sweeper Skred Red can play right now in the Modern metagame. The real value in this card is the exile clause that makes it so the creatures it deals damage to do not enter the graveyard.
  -  [Sweltering Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=426851): Another three-mana sweeper that hits for three, but it cycles instead of exiling. If the exile clause on Anger is less often relevant and there are several decks that are not affected by sweepers in the meta, Sweltering Suns may be the superior choice.
  -  [Volcanic Fallout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382401): There are two reasons this card actually sees any play. It is instant speed version of Pyroclasm, and it cannot be countered. The instant speed assists against manlands, and overall makes Skred Red more reactive as a control deck, since it can be cast at the most opportune moment. Uncounterability is good against decks like Merfolk and Delver to dodge Cursecatcher and Mana Leak. The direct damage can also come in handy against planeswalkers and weakened opponents, but be careful casting this against decks like Burn, since it does damage the user.
  -  [Kozilek's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407608): The devoid is good against Etched Champions, Master of Waves, and other pro-red creatures. It is instant speed, but can be countered. It does not damage the user, but neither does it hit the opponent. The graveyard trigger is essentially useless. That said this has become the default instant speed sweeper over Volcanic Fallout.
  -  [Blasphemous Act](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=389443): This card can end a game if played at the right time when combined with a Boros Reckoner. Unfortunately, it is particularly slow for a board wipe, and relies on the opponent going very wide with creatures, or otherwise surviving into the late game to generate the necessary mana.
  -  [Obliterate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=416753): A rather fringe card, but it is surprisingly a fantastic choice in control heavy metagames. Do yourself a favor though and make sure you haven't played your land for turn before you play this though.

[Back to Top](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index)

## Ramp
Ramp serves the role of speeding out larger threats and keeping up with the fast-paced meta of the Modern format. Ramp should generally have alternative uses that keep them from being bad late-game draws. 

  -  [Mind Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=405300): Ramp that can turn into a late-game cycler. Everything the deck wants in a mana rock that can also be pitched to Pia and Kiran.
  -  [Simian Spirit Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=124474): One of Modern's only forms of free mana. This card enables the back-breaking turn 1 Blood Moon at the cost of card disadvantage. It can also be used at instant speed, to cast a Skred or Bolt when tapped out, or trick your opponent into wasting a Mana Leak. Don't be afraid to hard cast it late game either, as while it is very, very weak, it can still be a threat or a blocker.
  -  [Coldsteel Heart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=405178): This is ramp that adds to the snow count, thus enabling a four damage Skred as soon as turn 3. Since the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397816) [ban](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-18-2016-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2016-01-18) however this card has lost value when compared to Mind Stone or Simian Spirit Guide, as it enters tapped and does not provide anything besides a single color of mana. It can be flipped with Scrying Sheets.

[Back to Top](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index)
 
## Utility
There are a number of other tools Skred Red can use to fight other strategies. In a format as diverse as Modern, it is impossible to find a catch-all solution. Below is a list of cards that are handy in a variety of matchups.

  -  [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370419): One of the best cards in Modern. When not expected, Blood Moon effectively wrecks the entire game plan of some decks. Bear in mind that it does affect Skred Red's own lands; fortunately though, Scrying Sheets and Mouth of Ronom retain their snow typing (because snow is a [supertype](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Supertype)), so they will still count towards Skred's damage output.
  -  [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413773): This card has ever-increasing relevance against many decks and cards. This card makes [Tarmgoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397682) into a 0/1, [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=227676) into a worse [Ambush Viper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220644), and keeps [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370458) from coming back. It is also a great hindrance or a downright blowout for decks like [Living End](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-living-end-8966#online), [Dredge](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-dredge-26688#online), and delve strategies.
  -  [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=46000): Land destruction attacks uninteractive and late-game-oriented decks, both of which typically need many lands to function. Molten Rain is among the best and most versatile of them. It comes down on turn three, and the two damage can sometimes be useful for pecking at planeswalkers or just getting in for more damage. Can also be paired with Blood Moon to remove any basic the opponent has. Generally more of a sideboard card, as it has little effect against fast aggro decks.
  -  [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383204): An alternative to Torch of Defiance. While Pyromaster boasts far fewer abilities than ToD, there is still some upside to running her. Foremost is the +1 of Pyromaster, which clears Lingering Soul tokens, Infect creatures, or other miscellaneous one-toughness dudes far more easily than Torch's -3. Also, Pyromaster's 0 works in more favorable ways than Torch's +1. Lands can still be played, and the flipped card need not be cast immediately. Unfortunately, Pyromaster has no way to protect herself from larger threats, and her ult does an effective nothing a good portion of the time.
  -  [Tezzeret's Gambit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397670): Fortunately for mono-red, Phyrexian mana brings Divination to the Skred toolbox. Unfortunately for Skred, Divination is not the most exciting of Magic cards, but if the need is for card draw, here it is. Gambit has a couple extra tricks up its proverbial sleeve as well, involving proliferate. The most obvious application is to speed up Koth's -5 or Chandra's -7 by a turn, which might catch an opponent off-guard, or just get to winning faster. With Gambit, Koth, and a mana rock, he can be ult'ed as soon as turn four. Also very interesting, the opponent's counters can be proliferated as well. While it is not idea to tick up opponents' planeswalkers, it is perfectly fine to add another -1/-1 counter to Kitchen Finks, or to kindly tick up their Aether Vial for them. Coldsteel Heart builds can put Heart on blue if they have enough red already, in order to remove the damage taken from Gambit (and to make the opponent sweat a bit as you might be faking counter magic, maybe).
  -  [Commune with Lava](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394521): This is the equivalent of red [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253534), except it doesn't gain life and you must cast the cards by the end of your turn. Beggars can't be choosers though, and this card is still packed with blowout potential in the form of card advantage. It is generally always correct to cast it on the opponent's end step, unless you have more mana than time.

## Sideboard
The sideboard doesn't take a back seat to the mainboard. Running the right sideboard haymakers can be the difference between winning and losing. Make sure to pack the right interaction.

  -  Additional [threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_threats.2Fwin_conditions): Typically Stormbreath Dragon or Batterskull, these come in against control decks as additional threats to ovewhelm the opponent. Each has its own upside, such as the protection on Stormbreath or the lifelink on Batterskull, which make them suitable to come in against other matchups as well. Goblin Rabblemaster is another popular sideboard threat against removal-lite decks, where it provides a very fast clock.
  -  Additional [sweepers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sweepers): For decks that go small and wide, sweepers are blowout answers that may be necessary in greater numbers post-board. Different sweepers excel at different things, so having a variety can be an advantage.
  -  Additional [removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_single_target_removal): Not all removal is created equal, and sometimes you can't fit in the right removal spell for every situation. Dismember and Roast have real downsides, but are nice when you need to hit bigger threats. Abrade is below rate, but usable in more situations. Ratchet Bomb can cure what ails you, and though it is slow it is one of the better answers to protection from red, problem noncreature permanents, and hexproof threats.
  -  Additional [utility](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_utility): The fourth Blood Moon is not a bad sideboard option, and non-Scourge decks may consider moving some copies of Relic to the sideboard. Molten Rains are more often a sideboard choice, as they can fall short in faster matchups. Sideboard card advantage engines like Chandras or Commune with Lava can give extra game against control.
  -  [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370512): Normally run as a one-of in the mainboard, this card is great out of the sideboard as additional removal or an answer to pro-red creatures.
  -  [Sudden Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370388): The important part of this card is it cannot be responded to, meaning the opponent cannot protect the creature taking the damage. It can also come in against decks where simply more removal or burn is necessary.
  -  [Ricochet Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191549): One of the best answers for counterspells, which Skred Red is generally weak to. This card can serve many purposes beyond countering countermagic as well, such as redirecting removal, burn, or [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=393818). 
  -  [Boil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45373): Like Ricochet Trap, this card fights countermagic. Unlike Ricochet Trap, blue mages don't come back from this. More narrow; more powerful.
  -  [Reverberate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=290289): Another great answer to countermagic. This card has uses against other archetypes that rely on instants and sorceries as well. If you are unsure about it, try one in the mainboard and find out what happens.
  -  [Sowing Salt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74623)/[Crumble to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=401850): Great answers for decks like Tron, and Scapeshift in situations where Valakut is played before the opponent combos off. Costing four mana makes them a little too slow and not as universally useful as Molten Rain.
  -  [Shattering Spree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=97233): The most-played answer for artifacts. It can play around countermagic by targeting a single artifact with multiple Replicate copies, and serves as an answer to [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370411) set on one, since the replicated copies are not cast and will not trigger Chalice.
  -  [Shatterstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=130370): The artifact ["Wrath of God"](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413580). Depending on the number artifacts it cleans up when cast, it can be better or worse than Spree. Unlike Spree, it can hit Etched Champion.
  -  [Vandalblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=405431): The best of both worlds in artifact destruction, it can come down early to slow an assault, or it can be overloaded as a board wipe. It doesn't hit as many things early as Spree, and it wipes later than Shatterstorm, but the upside is it play both roles.
  -  [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=48326): It is the decree of Wizards that non-blue colors cannot have fair counterspells, so Skred Red can turn to Chalice as a way to interact with uninteractive decks like Ad Nauseam, Storm, or Burn. It is generally brought in with a single charge counter against decks that are unaffected by the deck's one-mana spells like Lightning Bolt and Skred - decks that do not run many creatures like the aforementioned Burn and Ad Nauseam (Burn's creatures are easily stonewalled by a Boros Reckoner or Eternal Scourge, or swept up by an Anger or the like) or decks that run insanely low curves like Death Shadow and Bogles. Chalice is also good in a select other few games when it could be set to two or zero. Affinity is vulnerable to both these modes, where a Chalice on zero on the play cripples their opener, and a Chalice on two stops their haymakers like Ravager, Plating, and Overseer. Chalice on zero also interferes with Living End or decks running Ancestral Vision.
  -  [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45478): This card shores up red's weakness to large creatures and cripples decks that rely heavily on them such as Eldrazi Tron. Rely on planeswalkers and Pia/Kiran thopters to win though it.
  -  [Dragon's Claw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221523): The best card Skred red can play against Burn decks, but not much else. It counts for our spells as well as theirs.
  -  [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253581): Likely the most versatile sideboard card that no one is playing, the Needle can be played against almost any deck that relies on activated abilities. It provides a fast answer to walkers and interaction with certain combos.
  -  [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397743): Spellskite excels against Bogles, which can occasionally give Skred a hard time. It can also interact (albeit poorly) with some combo decks in the format, such as Ad Nauseam and Valakut. The deck cannot produce blue mana (unless running Coldsteel Heart) to pay for the ability which is a large downside against decks like Burn, which Spellskite is traditionally very good against, and the advantages gained against Infect are marginal as Infect is already a very good matchup.
  -  [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233069): Rather self-explanatory. Bring this in against decks with valuable etb effects, like Humans or Counters Company. Don't run it in the same build as Pia and Kiran, however, as it is not often worthwhile to cut a threat for a card like Torpor Orb.
  -  [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397706): Extracts key pieces from decks that rely heavily on them. Do note the piece must make it to the graveyard. Good against decks like Dredge or Jeskai Nahiri.  
  -  [Trinisphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=43545): A good choice for slowing down decks that cast a lot of very cheap spells. This card excels in a combo-heavy metagame against decks like Storm, Ad Nauseam, and Infect. It also has applications against other decks that abuse cheap spells, such as Delver. It can even slow down a Burn deck by a marginal amount. Despite its symmentry, the high mana curve of Skred Red means this will always hurt the opponent much more, so long as it it brought in against the right decks.
  -  [Thorn of Ametyst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=140166): Another card that is used for slowing down opposing decks. Like Trinisphere, this card works well against Storm and Phyrexian mana spells. Unlike Trinisphere, this card can slow down larger spells, but does very little against cheaper ones.
  -  [Damping Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=443101): A card to tech specifically against Tron, Amulet of Vigor, and Storm-esque decks. If these archetypes are giving you trouble, Sphere provides another way to lock down their game plan until they find an answer.

# The Core of Skred Red and Sample Decklists
Skred Red decks are extremely flexible and can be adapted fairly well to any metagame. This list here, however, has been identified as roughly what the "core" of any mono-red build should be:  
  - 20-21x Snow-Covered Basics  
  - 2-4x Scrying Sheets and/or other utility lands (this includes fetchlands)  
  - 8-13x [Threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_threats.2Fwin_conditions) 
    - Unlike other control decks Skred Red has to be threat dense as we expect to have to play 2-3 threats in a game just to win as we can't really defend a threat with anything like counter magic.  
  - 4x Lightning Bolt  
  - 4x Skred  
  - 0-2x [Additional removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_single_target_removal) for dealing with pro-red creatures, or large creatures that come out early.  
  - 3-4x Blood Moon or Molten Rain  
  - 3-5x [Sweepers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sweepers)  
  - 3-4x [Ramp Cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_ramp)  
  - 0-4x [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413773)  
  - And the rest of the deck is basically [Utility](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_utility) cards.
  
## [Classic Skred](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/classic-skred/)
Often referred to as "Reckoner" or "Traditional" Skred these lists play a bit more aggressively and have a late game win condition of hitting Boros Reckoner with your own removal. It is not unusual to see these lists try to maximize this by playing a high number of [sweepers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sweepers) compared to other builds.
  
## [Superfriends Skred](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/06-02-16-big-skred/)
This variant focuses on winning exclusively with planeswalkers and has the best matchup of any variant against draw-go style control lists, while sacrificing its effectiveness against aggressive decks.

## [Dragon Skred](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/03-09-16-dragon-skred/)
A list that runs both Thunderbreak Regent and Stormbreath Dragon to overwhelm and race the opponent with their evasion, big bodies, and punishment effects.

## [Eternal Skred](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/eternal-skred-1/)
This variant maximizes the use of [Eternal Scourge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=414296) as a super-resilient, recurrable creature. This is the current "Best Build" of Skred Red and was popularized by [Kevin Mackie](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpdfw16/skred-red-with-kevin-mackie-2016-11-06) and [Trevor May](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36462_Modern-Mayhem--Skred-Red-.html).  
  
## Why Mono Red?
Skred Red is not actually just built around the card Skred itself. The biggest reason the deck is mono-red is that it enables [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=266362), which is and important piece to both racing combo and fighting control. Skred Red also benefits from an all-snow build with its namesake and the underrated [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=121204), which give the deck control-esque elements to fight midrange or aggro. For this matchup-encompassing strategy it is imperative to have a critical mass of both snow lands and mountains - a setup most consistently achieved through playing mono red.

## Should You Splash a Color?
Though historically the mono red build has had the most success, dabbling in splash colors is also an option. This is still fairly debated, but in essence you should only need to splash a color when you want to answer matchups you cannot beat normally in mono-red. Here are some general tips for splashing a color:

  - You must play on-color fetchlands.
  - No more than five non-snow lands, otherwise Skred itself may no longer be a worthwhile card.
  - Do not play Scrying Sheets. While there are non-red snow lands, we must play four fetchlands and a shockland for a consistent source of the splash color. This means in a list with 23 lands, there are only 18 cards Scrying Sheets can reveal, and while Scrying Sheets can still produce card advantage, it hurts the deck's consistency because it cannot produce any color. If you decide to running Scrying Sheets anyway, do not run any more than one, maybe two, at the most.
  - For each non-mountain basic land beyond two that you run, consider cutting a copy of Koth of the Hammer since, his -2 and -5 abilities suffer greatly - assuming you even want to play Koth at all.

In a 23 land build, the manabase will probably look like this:  
 - 1 shockland that provides both your colors  
 - 4 on-color fetchlands  
 - 2+ basic lands that produce the splash color  
 - 18-19 Snow-Covered Mountains
 - 3-4 [Coldsteel Heart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=405178) OR [Ravnica signets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+[Signet]) OR [Mirrodin talismans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5Btalisman%5D&set=%7C%5B%22Mirrodin%22%5D) OR [Into the North](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=121199)

### Color Splash Sample Decklists
  -  [Ajani Skred/RW Skred](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/ajani-skred-1/):  
This version splashes white for removal and the planeswalker [Ajani Vengeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=174852). Other builds may also try a [Nahiri, the Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=410012) route with a 1 of [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397905)
  
  -  [Blue Moon Skred](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/blue-moon-skred-soggy-skred/):  
While it is not what this primer covers, this deck plays four copies of Skred and is thus realistically considered a "Skred Deck" however past this post here you are better off looking at discussions in Blue Moon threads and not here.

  -  RG Skred:  
This archetype has been discussed lately on the sub reddit. However, because it is fairly new there are no solid lists available.

# Playing Skred Red
Skred Red is a midrange deck that has a control element. When playing the deck, your general aim is to answer threats your opponents play while applying pressure from a limited number of sources at a time.  
This seems simple enough, but threat assessment and timing can be very important, as the low amount of draw power in the deck means removal must be maximized.

## Opening Hands and Mulligans
When deciding on an opening hand you require a few things:

- 1-2 pieces early game interaction (single target removal or a sweeper)
- A [threat](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_threats.2Fwin_conditions)
- optimally a ramp card
- 2-3 lands
- It is possible to keep a one-land hand, but you need a way to draw cards in it via Relic of Progenitus or Pyrite Spellbomb. Overall, the best practice is only to keep a one-land hand when you are on the draw.  

## Card Interactions
* Koth of the Hammer
   - When Blood Moon is in play, Koth's +1 ability targets any mountain, meaning that if you need to, you can untap one of your opponent's "mountains" and make it a 4/4 creature, thus allowing you to kill it with a Skred or other removal spell.
  - Koth's -2 can make for an unexpected burst of mana. Utilize this to make Stormbreath Dragon monstrous, resolve spells through suspected Mana Leaks, recast them after being Remanded, bounce and recast Batterskull, or to equip Batterskull. Just bear in mind that it's often more correct just to +1 or -5.
  - Koth's +1 untaps a land, which can be used to ramp you by one mana instead of just bashing.
  - There are times where it is not correct to activate Koth's -5 ability and just bring him up to six loyalty. These times can be fairly obvious, like when you already have a Koth of the Hammer emblem since they do not stack. It can also be fine to not ult Koth when you have a small number of actual mountains (2-3), or you are faced with an uniteractive opponent and it is more beneficial to cast a threat and continue swinging with 4/4 mountains than to ult and spend whole turns dealing one damage per mountain. These scenarios do not happen often, but are worth considering depending on how you plan to approach the matchup.
* Scrying Sheets
  - Scrying Sheets is primarily a way to get value out of extra unspent mana, and the primary goal is to give you a spell to cast for the turn as your draw instead of a useless land. Because it can only draw mana sources in the typical Skred build, it is less useful for digging through the library and more so for ensuring the quality of your draw steps, and as such resolving threats or interacting with the board take priority over activations a good percentage of the time.
  - It is always preferable to activate on your opponent's end step in order to preserve mana after you draw on your turn, however, it is correct to use Scrying Sheets on upkeep in the late game when you have enough mana to cast anything you could draw, and would otherwise be going into an unknown draw (for instance, you are topdecking and flipped a land on the opponent's end step with Sheets, or you played your last threat the previous turn and need more gas immediately, perhaps due to the threat being answered). Typically, you will not want to activate on upkeep if you do not have seven or eight mana (maybe more depending on you high end), because if you activate and cannot cast a Stormbreath or Koth subsequently, you won't be able to do anything if you draw those threats.
  - If you have extra mana you can activate Scrying Sheets before you activate the exile ability of a Chandra (Pyromaster or Torch of Defiance) or Outpost Siege. Do this to cut through lands you might not want to flip, or to find out if you can or even want to spend the activation to cast the card on top.
  - If you have two Scrying Sheets active in the late game, and the first activation reveals a non-snow permanent, then Relic of Progenitus, Pyrite Spellbomb, or Mind Stone can be used to draw the top card to give the second activation a chance to hit a snow card.
* Boros Reckoner 
  - Anger of the Gods with a Reckoner out will cleanly kill a Wurmcoil Engine and prevent tokens from spawning (since it is exiled, Wurmcoil Engine's ability won't trigger).
  - If you run Batterskull, equipping it on a Reckoner allows you to gain life off of Reckoner's ability as well as his normal damage.
  - Casting Skred to target your Boros Reckoner is amazing late game, but only really do this if you can directly kill your opponent, otherwise it is likely a better choice to just hold on to your Skred.
* Eternal Scourge
  - The best use of this creature is as a value blocker in the early stages of the game, although he is a decent attacker when you need to apply pressure.
  - Scourge exiles himself when he is targeted by any interaction your opponent has, even spells that are not necessarily removal, like [Vines of Vastwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397747).
  - You can exile an Eternal Scourge from your graveyard with your own [Relic of Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Discussion.aspx?multiverseid=174824) by just tapping it and choosing yourself as the target.

# Matchups
Here is where the bulk of the primer is; bear in mind this is incomplete and ever-changing, and obviously not every matchup can be covered. The matchups are organized alphabetically with a date of the most recent update done to that matchup since the Modern metagame, and deck archetypes can shift fairly dramatically over the course of time.  
We also provide links to stock decklists and "relatively" up to date primers.

## Abzan Midrange
Date: 11/17/2016  
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-abzan#paper)  
[Primer Link](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/tier-1-modern/511600-abzan-midrange-junk-bgw-souls-bg-rock) - MTGSalvation  
This is another GBx deck just like Jund, basically I'll going to refer you to the [Jund matchup](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_jund)  since it involves largely the same gameplan. The biggest difference is that Abzan plays [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382191) and the former standard all star [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386666) alongside the obvious white splash cards in Modern.  
Generally they will not play [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397731) due to the higher mana curve, and they play mana dorks like [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397709) or [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=416933), which are good to kill off early to avoid turn 3-4 Rhinoes. The addition of [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=414489) to the archetype has made the deck fairly graveyard reliant (more so than Jund), which makes Relic of Progenitus much stronger in the matchup overall. Be aware of Grim Flayer's ability to put cards in the graveyard and fix the opponent's draws, as it will make it difficult for a single Relic to stop Delerium and Tarmogoyfs.

## Affinity
Date: 12/12/2016  
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-affinity-8972#online)  
[Primer](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/tier-1-modern/219590-affinity) - MTGSalvation  
/r/AffinityForArtifacts  
Affinity (also less commonly referred to as Robots) is an artifact-based aggressive deck, named after the [affinity](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Affinity) mechanic of [original Mirrodin block](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Mirrodin_block). Its artifact synergies are its hallmark, and it is a premier tier 1 deck in Modern.  

Affinity is built around abusing the artifact type. There are two major types of threats in the deck. Cheap threats that allow Affinity to create board presence very quickly, and artifact-synergy payoff cards that reward the player for controlling a lot of artifacts. The common payoff cards to be aware of are:

  - [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420866): Provides a huge power boost to the equipped creature. Their mana can also support the instant-speed equip.
  - [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370510): A ticking time bomb that can sacrifice most of their board for a single, huge swing.
  - [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=205036): A slower threat that takes over the game if unanswered.
  - [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397710): Only dies to colorless sources. Less a threat on its own, very strong with Plating or Ravager.
  - [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420709): Like a Cranial Plating stapled to a Steel Overseer, only less threatening over the long run.

This matchup is straightforward for a Skred player. Keep the board clear. Timing of [sweepers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sweepers) and efficient use of [removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_single_target_removal) is incredibly key. Missing the correct timing when killing a Ravager, Master, Overseer, or Champion can potentially lose you the game.  

After Skred Red's removal suite, the biggest thing the deck brings to matchup is its inevitability. Bereft of the payoffs, Affinity cards are very weak. As such, Affinity will be hard-pressed to apply pressure once you get past turn 3 or 4. Skred Red is much more suited to winning in the late game than Affinity, and will out-draw them most of the time after the initial onslaught is dealt with.

The best cards in the matchup for a Skred player include:

  - [Removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_single_target_removal)/[sweepers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sweepers), for killing threats
  - [Pia and Kiran Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=398453), for slowing Affinity down in the same way removal does
  - [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=266362), for applying pressure

[Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370419) can stop Affinity's [manlands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&text=+[blinkmoth]&name=+[nexus]). In essence, it acts as a glorified removal spell that lets us make better use of our more general removal.

For [sideboarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard), artifact hate like Shattering Spree, Vandalblast, and Shatterstorm are almost a no-brainer. Additional removal such as Sudden Shock also suffices, and colorless removal like Pyrite Spellbomb will deal with Etched Champion. Pithing Needle shuts down Cranial Plating, Arcbound Ravager, and several other pieces of Affinity. On the flipside, mainboard cards like Relic of Progenitus and one or two copies of Blood Moon (not all of them) are generally doing less than what is desired for the matchup. Blood Moon is typically undervalued in the matchup, as our opponent generally plays few colored spells and can be circumvented by Springleaf Drum and Mox Opal, but it still has value when combined with artifact romoval on their colored sources or to shut down their manlands.

Boarding out Relic makes Eternal Scourge worse, and it could be considered for sideboarding out because many of Affinity's creatures have evasion, but make sure you keep in enough answers for Etched Champion. Other possible cuts include high-cost things like Chandras, which may be too slow for the matchup.  

Bear in mind that Affinity has access to some sideboard cards that can grind us out of the game like [Ghirapur Aether Grid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=398517), and normally runs 1-2 additional copies of Etched Champion. Some lists even run their own Pithing Needle, which can shut down our planeswalkers.

Thus, overall this matchup is a favorable 60/40 in all games; maybe 55/45 if the Affinity player knows how to play around our removal. The matchup can be quite the skill test for both pilots.

## Burn
Date: 11/17/2016  
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/385296#paper) - This is for a Naya build since that is most common.  
[Primer Link](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/tier-1-modern/650623-burn) - MTGSalvation  
Burn is, and likely always will be, the premiere aggressive strategy of Modern. It is a deck built with the most efficient damage-dealing spells available and can end the game as soon as turn 3, and no later than turn 5 if not answered. The general consensus is that, since burn can be built for as little as $30, you should always have some form of a game plan.  
Since we cannot interact very well with spells, we will typically need to interact with a burn deck's creatures:  

  -  [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=170987)
  -  [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386608)
  -  [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=380410)
  -  [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=234428)
  -  [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249401) - not played in every build

Usually, we are playing a race to survive. Against three-color Burn builds, one of our most impacting cards is Blood Moon, as it shuts off every spell that requires a color that is not red (12-16 cards on average). Our end goal is to play Blood Moon and a [threat](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_threats.2Fwin_conditions) to finish the opponent as quickly as possible, while playing removal spells on the Burn player's creatures (only ever aim Lightning Bolt at the opponent when it can be lethal).

Because of the reliance on Blood Moon to stop some of Burn's spells, Skred Red suffers against the overall weaker [mono-red version](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/13-12-15-ugO-burn/) of Burn, and to a lesser extent the red/white builds that forego green spells. The spells in this version are less efficient, but we will not be able to interact with the instants and sorceries they cast, so it comes down to a race.

In general, if we win it will not be quickly, and it is not unusual to end the game within range of a single Lightning Bolt. Ideally, we will not see too many Burn spells from our opponent, and will rely on our opponent drawing lands and not mono-red spells that they can cast through Blood Moon. Playing a threat is the biggest thing we can do, as closing the game is the best guarantee against Burn. Consider prioritizing threats in your opening hand over interaction like Blood Moon and Dragon's Claw. 

When [sideboarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard), it is recommended to lower your curve while bringing in cards that gain life like Dragon's Claw, Sun Droplet, or Batterskull out of our sideboard. Other cards to board in include Ricochet Trap and Spellskite to redirect burn spells, and Chalice of the Void to lock them out of one- and two-drops (keep in mind that most versions of Burn play artifact destruction in the sideboard that almost always costs two mana to cast. If you suspect that, set Chalice on two. Against three-color Burn, Blood Moon will stop Destructive Revelry, so it may be better to put Chalice on one in those matchups). Goblin Rabblemaster is a threat that will, in the best case, win the game on its very fast clock; but in a more likely scenario the opponent will be forced to spend a Bolt to kill it, which saves us some life.

You can lower your curve by boarding out your slower threats like a Chandra or Stormbreath Dragon, just make sure you keep enough threats overall so you can finish the game quickly.

Overall this matchup is 50/50 game one assuming we are on the play, 45/55 on the draw game one, and 60/40 games 2 and 3.

## Counters Company
Date: 2/11/2018 
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-counters-company#paper)  
[Primer](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/tier-2-modern/605889-abzan-company) - MTGSalvation  
Abzan Company is a creature-based combo deck. To begin, lets observe the main combo pieces in the deck:

  -  [Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=135500) --adds mana. Can untap if the controller places one -1/-1 counter on it.
  -  [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370458) --when it dies, it comes back in exchange for receiving a -1/-1 counter. Gains life when it enters.
  -  [Vizier of Remedies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=426740) --reduces the number of -1/-1 counters placed on the user's creatures by one. This effectively removes the cost of untapping Devoted Druid (for infinite mana) or the downside condition of persist on Kitchen Finks (for infinite life with a sacrifice outlet).
  -  [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409961)/[Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=423848)/[Rhonas the Indomitable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=429887) --outlets for infinite mana by Devoted Druid. Also reasonable creatures in their own right.
  -  [Viscera Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=376569) --sacrifice engine for Kitchen Finks. Allows the user to scry 1 infinitely with the combo.
 
To assemble these pieces the deck plays a playset of both [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394519) and [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383209).

Now that we understand the main combo pieces, we come the understanding that the best way to deal with Counters Company is removal, and lots of it. Board wipes are key to this matchup, especially Anger of the Gods to bury Kitchen Finks. If you see Devoted Druid, kill it as soon as possible, or in response to a Chord or Collected Company, as once Vizier of Remedies is on the battlefield it is impossible to stop them from gaining infinite mana without a split second effect like Sudden Shock, because you cannot respond to the mana ability and they can put more untap effects on the stack in response to normal removal.

Blood Moon is a decent play against Counters Company. The deck is generally green/white splashing black, with only a few basics. Blood Moon and removal on their creatures can shut them out of their aggro plan in [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233242) or lock them out of playing color-hungry cards like Chord of Calling or [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430326).

The deck is not incapable of grinding out a win or swinging into the red zone. Lists often run several versatile tutor targets such as [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=433121), [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409997), and [Selfless Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=414332). Do not let the opponent catch you off-guard with a Collected Company or Chord of Calling.

Seeing as it is a creature-based combo deck, we are naturally very good against it, and it is 60/40 in our favor on an even field.

## Dredge
Date: 3/13/2017 
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-dredge-26688#paper)  
[Primer Link](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/tier-1-modern/712805-dredge) -MTGSalvation  
Dredge is a unique form of an aggressive creature-based deck that utilizes the graveyard and the [dredge](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Dredge) mechanic from the original Ravnica block. When playing against dredge the Skred player needs to be aware of several things.  
The most important things are the dredge cards themselves (of the more commonly played ones):

  -  [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394056)  
  -  [Golgari Thug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=292953)
  -  [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370398)  
  -  [Dakmor Salvage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370456)  
  -  [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=87922)  

We also have to be aware of how they plan to win the game:

  -  [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=410014)  
  -  [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=192230)  
  -  [Conflagrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=114909)
  -  [Scourge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=425936) or [Rally the Peasants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413567)

And we need to be aware of how they enable the dredge machanic:

  -  [Cathartic Reunion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=417682)  
  -  [Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413670)  
  -  [Insolent Neonate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409922)  

Now that we are familiar with the cards, it is important to know how Dredge decks function. Dredge is primarily an aggro deck, but it has the unique capability to play the long game with recurrable threats and the combination of Life from the Loam and [Conflagrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=114909). The threats dredge plays are not scary on their own, but the speed at which they deploy is the source of their strength. As with traditional aggro decks, [board wipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sweepers) are very good. Anger of the Gods is the best sweeper to play against Dredge, as it shuts down the recursive nature of many of Dredge's creatures, but other board wipes come in handy to slow down Narcomoebas and Bloodghasts.

However, dealing with Dredge's threats on the battlefield will not win you all of your games. The power of Dredge comes from their graveyard, and it may come as no surprise that the most important card in this matchup is Relic of Progenitus. The timing of this card takes practice, but for the most part, you want to be cracking Relics to clear away the payoff cards ([Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=410014), [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=192230), [Conflagrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=114909)). Also keep in mind that in fringe scenarios, Relic can be used to stop a Narcomoeba while its trigger is on the stack.

As the game goes long, watch out for Life from the Loam, and begin to prioritize it as a target for Relic. Loam is essential to the mid- and late-game strategy of Dredge, as it allows them to recur Bloodghasts and build toward a lethal Conflagrate. A Dredge player without Loam may be stuck in a position where their Bloodghasts are in the graveyard, but they have no lands in hand, forcing them to chose between dredging or drawing, under which circumstances the pressure on us will be minimal. Blood Moon is particularly interesting in this matchup, specifically for its ability to potentially lock the opponent out of green mana for Loam. Most Dredge decks play a very greedy mana base in case they need to cast Stinkweed Imps or even Prized Amalgams out of their hand, so leaving them with all mountains puts a wrench in some of their plans. However, as most good dredge enablers are red, Blood Moon is ineffective against Dredge's main game plan. Sideboard down to one or two copies post-board, depending on how much interaction you can bring in.

[Sideboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard) options include additional sweepers and anything that can shut down their graveyard effects. Graveyard hate like Grafdigger's Cage and Surgical Extraction are obviously amazing in this matchup. Boros Reckoner profitably blocks almost all of Dredge's threats. Reverberate is particularly interesting option as dredge plays a lot of cards we could benefit from ourselves, like Cathartic Reunion (we draw three without having to discard), a large Conflagrate (we could kill our opponent or wipe their board), a Faithless Looting (to help us dig for an answer), et cetera. Players running Chalice of the Void may find one or two copies useful for stopping Life from the Loam and late-game Cathartic Reunions.

Also be sure you have plan against a potential [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370560) which they may use to play around Anger of the Gods. Pithing Needle is a good answer to this card, as it prevents them from playing around Anger and cripples the speed at which it comes down.

Dredge can be a swingy matchup since they can have some very explosive starts to a game, but generally the matchup is favorable for us at a decent 60/40.

## Infect
Date: 10/9/2016  
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-infect-16996#paper)  
[Primer](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/tier-1-modern/557165-infect) - MTGSalvation  
Infect is an aggressive deck that uses creatures with the namesake [infect](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Infect) ability in combination with power-boosting effects to win the game very quickly.  
Any creatures with this ability are concerns for us.

  -  [Glistener Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233052)  
  -  [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214383)  
  -  [Viridian Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=213772) (normally a one-of or a sideboard card against affinity)  
  
They also run a land that becomes a creature with infect: [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=213731).   
  
The deck does not run many creatures beyond that list, and much of the remainder is a combination of pump spells to capitalize on infect, protection for those few creatures, or both in the case of Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense. At the same time, because the deck runs so few creatures and relies very heavily on them, our removal is at its best. Playing against infect is a game of getting their creatures off the board, even through their disruption. Infect is extremely fast, capable of killing as early as turn two. Make sure you pack interaction.

Fortunately, Skred Red does not lack for [removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_single_target_removal), and this is typically a very good matchup for us. A couple things to keep in mind:

  -  Always try to remove their creatures on their end step or on your turn. Attempting to Bolt a Glistener Elf on or before combat is asking to be blown out by a pump spell. If you attempt to remove their creatures at points where they are unable to go to combat, you at least save yourself some potential infect damage or make them use a protection spell. This rule applies even if they are tapped out, as Mutagenic Growth cost no mana to cast.
  -  They do not run a basic island, so if we have a Blood Moon out, not only does it shut off Inkmoth Nexus, but they only way they can play a Blighted Agent is with a [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397709). Definitely consider removing Hierarch if they have no infect creatures at that point.
  -  Be aware of your opponent's hand size, and the potential infect damage that could come of it. To this end, know the pump and protection spells the deck typically employs. Again, the timing for your removal is very important.
  -  Watch out for [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397743) (generally out of the sideboard) or [Wild Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=276199) (almost always in the sideboard). Know that artifact hate is not an answer to Spellskite in this instance, as the hate will be particularly bad in most situations where they do not draw Spellskite.
  -  If you have to, do not be afraid to drag the game out. They cannot draw as many cards as we do to search for answers.

In [sideboarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard), more removal is acceptable, particularly Sudden Shock. Board wipes are also very good at dealing with creatures through protection like Vines of Vastwood and Spellskite. If you run Chalice of the Void, Chalice on one shuts down Glistener Elf and every pump spell in the deck except Become Immense, and our own Spellskites can similarly shut down their pump spells. Board out cards that do not interact with infect creatures, like Koth and Relic of Progenitus, or only interact with a select few of them (namely ground blockers that can only stop a Glistener Elf, like Boros Reckoner and Eternal Scourge). Infect cannot play the long game or stop what we are doing, so a Pia and Kiran or a Chandra can be enough to close out the game.

Overall the matchup is 70/30 in our favor, maybe even 80/20 if they do not know how to play around us.

## Jeskai Control
Date: 12/26/2016  
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-jeskai-control-26155#paper)  
[Primer](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/tier-2-modern/728834-jeskai-harbinger) - MTGSalvation  
  
The core of Jeskai control is a UW control shell that adds red mana for access to [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397722) and [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386343). It is a highly flexible core and a Jeskai player can play various different win conditions between [Nahiri](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=410012)/[Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397905) or an instant speed value/beatdown plan with cards like [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=240096).  

Control decks are naturally weak to aggressive strategies, so the essence of our game plan will be to resolve threats and turn them sideways. Threats are our best cards in this matchup.

In the early turns you want to play a Blood Moon and force the Jeskai player to have an answer to it. Do this even if the Jeskai player has basic lands, as their win condition in the late game is hampered, since it is usually heavily supported by [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=177545). If you know you can resolve a threat, however, threats always take precedence over Blood Moon. Because the goal in the late game is to have more cards than the opponent, do not be afraid to run out a threat into a potential counter spell. More often we will draw more threats than they will draw counter spells.

In opening hands we look for access to multiple threats, a Relic of Progenitus to fight [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=227676), and optimally a Blood Moon—all with an appropriate amount of mana to cast things. Cards like Skred, Anger of the Gods, and Roast that only deal damage to creatures are only good situationally, and can be a potential dead draw depending on just what kind of win condition your opponent is playing. Many of Jeskai Control's typical threats are difficult to answer at sorcery speed, if at all when it comes to man-lands like Colonnade, so sorcery-speed removal and board wipes are ineffective. Instant speed removal like Skred can answer may of the creature threats that they typically play, but is ineffective against Nahiri and other planeswalkers.

Many of the recommended [threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_threats.2Fwin_conditions) for Skred Red are very good against Jeskai Control if we can resolve them through a counter. Pia and Kiran Nalaar create three bodies that make their single-target removal look pretty bad. Eternal Scourge does similar things to their targeted removal, and the combination with Relic makes it even counter-proof. Planeswalkers survive their sweepers, which our other threats are weak to, and also avoid targeted removal like [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382192), though they are vulnerable to multiple Bolts and Helices. Stormbreath Dragon also dodges much of their removal, being only vulnerable to double Bolt and Supreme Verdict. Batterskull, when carefully played, can only be answered by a counter spell. Demigod of Revenge is strong against countermagic and non-exiling removal/sweepers. Batterskull, when played carefully, can only be stopped by counter spells.

Do not be afraid to just draw out a game that seems hopeless. A good threat off of the top can easily swing the game in your favor. Also, gaining an understanding of the opponent's deckbuilding choices and win condition greatly assist in making sideboard decisions.

[Sideboarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard) largely depends on how the Jeskai player aims to win the game. Here are some recommendations based on common builds:

Nahiri package:

  - Their main win condition will be using Nahiri's -8 to get Emrakul and attack for the win. Even if they do not outright kill us with Emrakul, we will lose most of out board and drop to five life or less, where they can finish us with burn spells. To counter this strategy, we should bring in more burn effects like Sudden Shock and Molten Rain to damage Nahiri, and threats like Goblin Rabblemaster to pressure her. Pithing Needle shuts her off entirely, and Surgical Extraction can take out subsequent Nahiris once you have dealt with one, in addition to further disrupting Snapcaster Mage (and there is also potential to exile Emrakul, should they draw it and discard it with Nahiri). We should take out removal that only hits creatures, especially at sorcery speed. Skred can still deal with Colonnades and Snapcasters, but if you have enough to board in, take them out.

Jeskai Flash:

  - This build runs significantly more creatures than a typical control list, generally Restoration Angel and other creature with enters effects to generate some sort of advantage. Our instant-speed removal is very good in this matchup, and sorcery speed removal can also be acceptable if it kills the Angel (which will be their most important threat). Because many of our cards are already good against creatures, not much sideboarding is necessary.

General notes:

  - Sweepers are typically bad against control decks due to their creature-light construction, so they should be taken out when possible. There are a couple of exceptions. Firstly, sweepers like Volcanic Fallout and Earthquake still apply pressure on the opponent's life total, so they can be kept in if you are lacking for better sideboard options. Secondly, Jeskai Control decks may sideboard in [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409577) to take advantage of the fact that sweepers are typically bad against them. If you win game 1, do not worry about potential Geists, because you can always side against them in game 3. You do not have the luxury to do this if you lose game 1, however, so keep in a couple sweepers.
  - These decks may be playing [Kor Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194708) in the sideboard. Pyrite Spellbomb can help against this threat, while also being a burn spell or cycler.
  - There are arguments for bring in land destruction like Molten Rain to attack Colonnades and their three-color mana base. It is largely a judgement call and could potentially be worth while against counter spells and their larger threats.
  - Since the games will typically go long, card advantage engines like Outpost Siege help to dig into our threats and answer our opponent's.

Overall the matchup is 55/45 in our favor game 1, and post-board could be between 60/40 or closer to 50/50 depending on your opponent's build. We are weak to their counter spells and strong against their removal, so the ratio they run greatly influences how good a matchup this is.

## Jund
Date: 11/17/2016  
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-jund-16746#paper)  
[Primer Link](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/tier-1-modern/571523-jund) -MTGSalvation  
Jund is probably the best example the Modern format has of a fair, interactive control/midrange deck. The goal of Jund is to run its opponent out of resources and use generally higher quality cards to beat its opponent down. The funny thing is that we can basically grind just as well as Jund can; the difference is that we incorporate a prison strategy in Blood Moon and Relic of Progenitus that is actually fairly effective against any traditional Jund list.  
In general there are a few cards we need to be concerned about from Jund:

  -  [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=235597)  
  -  An early game [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397682)  
  -  Targetteted discard in [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373632) and [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=416897)

Basically our early game can typically be weak to a good start with Jund. Usually we want to play a turn 1 Relic of Progenitus, and always exile a card with it whether it being from our opponent's graveyard or our own. Never waste a Skred on a [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397731), or [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420783) if you have a Lightning Bolt in hand. Save Skreds for Tarmogoyf or [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407596). Prepare for a long grindy game involving a lot of removal.

The best cards in  a typical Skred Red build are Blood Moon, Relic of Progenitus, a Chandra planeswalker, Pia and Kiran Nalaar, Eternal Scourge, and Koth of the Hammer. All those cards provide us more value for our strategy than the Jund player's cards provide for their strategy. Similar options that are good include Hangarback Walker, Batterskull, and Wurmcoil Engine. 
There are a few pointers that should be kept in mind:

  -  When attempting to kill a fairly large Tarmogoyf with a removal spell or sweeper in conjunction with Relic of Progenitus, always let your spell resolve first then exile all graveyards with the Relic. This makes the Tarmogoyf a 0/1 creature with damage marked on it, and once any player receives [priority](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Timing_and_priority) after the Relic ability resolves, [state-based effects](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/State-based_actions) are checked and the Tarmogoyf will die.
  -  If possible, always have one mana open to exile Relic so it does not get destroyed by [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253561) or [Kolaghan’s Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394613) without gaining us at least some value.
  -  Since the matchup is a midrange mirror, it is not unusual for the games to go long. Try to avoid going to time by playing and making decisions in a timely manner.
  -  Liliana of the Veil needs to be answered before she gets out of hand. The optimal play for Jund is to keep using her discard effect throughout the match to keep us drained of resources. Her -6 can be backbreaking if she reaches it.
  
In [sideboarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard), it is not often necessary to change much. In fact, the biggest concern we will have is to sideboard too much. Sweepers are perhaps the weakest cards in the matchup, since Jund will not often have a lot of creatures. A few of these can be traded out for removal spells to deal with Dark Confidant, Tarmogoyf, or an early Scavenging Ooze. Outpost Siege provides card advantage in a similar way that Chandras do, and are more difficult for Jund to destroy. Most Jund decks run very few basic lands (generally one forest and two swamps), so Molten Rain coupled with Blood Moon can lock the opponent out of Lilianas or green/black spells altogether.  

Overall the matchup is 55-60/45-40 in our favor if played correctly.

## Kiki Chord/Evolution Toolbox
Date: 10/9/2016  
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-kiki-chord-25538#paper)  
[Primer](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/developing-competitive-modern/598381-kiki-chord-kiki-company-kiki-evolution) - MTGSalvation  
Kiki Toolbox is a primarily Naya (white-green-red) colored creature toolbox deck that aims to play a grindy game with a combo finish of (usually) [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=50321) and [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=240096). Builds for this deck are often tuned for specific metagames and it is not unusual to play against a four-color variant. Here are the most commonly played cards:  

  -  [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=416933): Their optimal turn 1 play  
  -  [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220566): Their best source of ramp  
  -  [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=368951): Dissuades interaction with their combo  
  -  [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420783): Graveyard hate  
  -  [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249405): Artifact/enchantment removal  
  -  [Selfless Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=414332): Board sweeper protection  
  -  [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397743): Targeted removal protection  
  -  [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=405216): Used as part of a combo chain explained later on  
  -  [Pia and Kiran Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=398453): Good in their deck as it is in ours. Goes well with Restoration Angel  
  -  [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420691): Brings back Kiki-Jiki or many of the above

The most common build of this type of deck is centered around the card [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383209) which is a card with the [convoke](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Convoke) ability, which allows the deck to cast it very early if they build up a strong board presence. This card is used to find creatures that can answer a variety of situations, or it can grab a missing combo piece.
If they use Chord specifically for combo peices the player will normally:

  -  Chord for X=3 to grab an [Eternal Witeness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=405216) which upon entering will trigger to retrieve the Chord of Calling from the graveyard.  
  -  Next turn the player can then Chord for X=4 to grab a [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=240096) which enters the battlefield and "[flicker](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Flickering)" the Eternal Witness, which will once again return the Chord of Calling
  -  Next turn the player can then Chord for X=5 to grab the [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397698)  
  -  Once the player has both Kiki-Jiki and Restoration Angel they can then activate Kiki-Jiki's ability to make a copy of Restoration Angel, which will use its trigger on enter to flicker Kiki-Jiki. Kiki-Jiki will renter the battlefield untapped and ready to make yet another copy of a Restoration Angel. This process can be repeated endlessly. These token copies have [haste](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Haste) and can then attack for lethal damage.  

Obviously, this assumes that we do not interact with any creatures. The best way to interact is to kill the Kiki Jiki in response to the Restoration Angel targeting Kiki-Jiki, as the opponent will likely have more Restoration Angels in the deck than Kiki-Jikis. Killing Restoration Angel in response to it being targeted by Kiki-Jiki is another option if you feel you cannot take the damage, just be sure to have an answer to Kiki-Jiki as Skred Red cannot beat the value he provides by copying Eternal Witnesses and other creatures. Exiling Chord of Calling with Relic when they search for Eternal Witness will stop the chain above that leads them to tutoring for the full combo, so do this when possible.

Also be aware that the deck runs around 28 creatures, and can grind out games quite easily.

That said our strategy is fairly simple; we rely on our [sweepers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sweepers) to help keep the board state in control, while using our spot removal only when necessary. Chord of Calling is expensive when the opponent has no creature to help cast it, so plan for Chord of Calling with their creature count in mind and use extra removal to slow them down. Here are a few pointers:  

  -  It is important to play blockers for our planeswalkers, but the earlier we can slam a [threat](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_threats.2Fwin_conditions) like Koth of the Hammer the better.  
  -  Most of the time it is correct to use our creatures as blockers. Their creatures do not attack through ours easily, and sparing damage is important when we might take a couple late-game hits from Restoration Angel.   
  -  Blood Moon is an effective card against these decks, however, their mana creatures and few basic lands will allow them to play around Blood Moon.  
  -  Kiki-Jiki is very vulnerable to removal, and if you can convince your opponent that you have it, they may take extra time to play around it. Try not to become empty-handed against them.

As for [sideboarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard), assuming the opponent is on a Naya build, it is not wrong to side down to two copies of Blood Moon. On a four-color build keep in 3-4 copies. [Utility](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_utility) cards like Relic of Progenitus can be boarded out in favor of additional removal like Pyrite Spellbomb or Sudden Shock. It is important to have an answer for [Kor Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194708) or [Burrenton Forge-Tender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382179) in games 2-3.

Overall the matchup is favorable for us, but we do need to play smart, so it is probably 55/45 overall, as a skilled pilot can definitely outplay us.

## Lantern Control
Date: 4/8/2018  
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-lantern-control-46419#paper)  
[Primer](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/developing-competitive-modern/221769-lantern-control) - MTGSalvation  
/r/LanternMTG/  
Lantern Control is a [prison](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Prison_deck) deck that attempts to keep their opponent from casting good spells for the majority of the game and winning through [milling](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Mill). They accomplish both of these goals through repeatable mill effects such as [Codex Shredder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253635) and [Ghoulcaller's Bell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=237362), used in combination with the eponymous [Lantern of Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=73927).

The game plan of the deck revolves around Lantern. Because the opponent knows the top card of your library, they can use their mill effects to get rid of good cards, making it so that most times you will draw lands, or other useless spells. The more mill effects they possess, the more completely they will be able to lock you out of the game.

Another artifact Lantern Control hinges on is [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45478). This is the deck's main way of dealing with creatures. Because Lantern Control's curve is very low (they run almost all one- and two-drops), they can empty their hand easily and make it so no creatures are able to attack.

Besides the main prison pieces, Lantern Control runs removal and discard such as [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253561) and [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=416897) to take care of threats the opponent has already drawn. [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397706) and [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253581) serve as further prison pieces to take care of cards the deck otherwise has difficulty beating, such as planeswalkers. Other cards will help search for their important artifacts, like [Ancient Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=193437), [Whir of Invention](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=423716), [Inventors' Fair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=417820), and [Academy Ruins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370424) (in combination with using their mill effects on themselves).

Lantern Control, with its ability to lock us out of decent draws, sounds like a challenging opponent. Their creatures are few and unthreatening, so our removal is often useless against them. Creatures like Eternal Scourge and Stormbreath Dragon are easy to trap under Ensnaring Bridge, and though Blood Moon can harm them, [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=208248)s and a largely artifact-based arsenal means Moon only hurts them passively (the best things Moon can do for us is to turn off their utility lands and trap cards in their hand like Abrupt Decay, to reduce the power of Ensnaring Bridge, so it is in no way bad, it just does not stop their main win condition), and it is terrible to draw in multiples. These dead draws all add up in game 1, which matters a lot against Lantern Control since the deck is so reliant on forcing you to make dead draws.

There are ways to combat Lantern Control still. Relic of Progenitus not only disrupts their Academy Ruins and their Surgical Extractions; the draw effect can be used to push through mill effects. This can be done by using the draw effect after the opponent has exhausted all their mill effects, even in response to the last mill effect. The same trick can be done with other draw effects like Mind Stone and Scrying Sheets, and even sorcery speed draw like Chandra can put pressure on the opponent by increasing the chances we get useful cards.

Because it is Lantern Control's goal to keep you from drawing relevant threats, doing so can often win the game. Lantern Control has difficulty dealing with a resolved Koth, Chandra, or Pia and Kiran, all of which can damage the opponent through an Ensnaring Bridge. These types of cards, which do not get hit by Abrupt Decay or Inquisition of Kozilek, should be of the highest priority to find and get on the battlefield in each game.

So game 1 is winnable, but very difficult due to the amount of useless removal and other cards in our deck. Fortunately, there are many [sideboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard) cards that at least do something against Lantern Control, and something is always better than nothing. Foremost, artifact removal is incredible against them, our own Pithing Needles included. Any burn spells that can chip away through an Ensnaring Bridge are also good, even Molten Rains, which can additionally deal with Inventor's Fair, and deal damage through possible [Leyline of Sanctities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397677) from their sideboard. Card draw and useful threats follow the line of increasing our number of must-answer cards as well. Of note, Goblin Rabblemaster is an improvement over Eternal Scourge for its faster clock and lesser power, forcing the opponent to get Ensnaring Bridge online, lest they just lose. Chalice of the Void on one locks them out of casting Lanterns, mill pieces, Ancient Stirrings, Surgical Extractions, discard spells, and Pithing Needles.

What comes out should be obvious. Removal that only hits creatures, and creatures that do nothing but attack. Start by cutting the [removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_single_target_removal), especially the [sweepers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sweepers), since the only creature they could be running that matters to us is [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397743) (which is a tech choice by the player and not a list staple). Depending on the number of cards you can bring in, you might consider keeping a Skred or two to deal with the Skite, or to hit your own Boros Reckoner if you have them. Eternal Scourges and Stormbreath Dragons force the opponent to find Bridge at least, so they are cut second if you can bring in enough cards from the side. 

The core principle of sideboarding is to make every card in your deck relevant in the matchup. Less than losing to a single card, Lantern Control is weak to entire decks full of good cards for the matchup. Because of game 1 removal stuck in our deck, the matchup is unfavorable at about 30/70, but flips to a more favorable 50/50 once we switch out eight or more cards post-side.

## Skred Red
Date: 11/17/2016  
Stock List ... assume the Eternal Skred list shown above in the sample decklists.  
Primer/[Back to Top](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index), [MTGSalvation](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/developing-competitive-modern/718932-skred-red)  
So here is how to win in the mirror match. Obviously with the Recent GP win Kevan Mackie put the deck on the map for a whole new teir of players. So I imagine this is general good information.  
Naturally, assume your opponent has just as much removal a you do. Generally our normal lines of play change entirely as other players have at minimum ten dead cards against each other (Blood Moon, Relic of Progenitus, Anger of the Gods) and not enough sideboard options to make up for them.  
In general, the best advice is to not play Koth of the Hammer into an empty board since you opponent very likely will repeat your play.

"You don't want your hammer getting hammered." ~/u/Lordofcatarina  

Game 1 boils down to who plays the most threats and gets attacks in. Obviously, if you can start activating Scrying Sheets first you will greatly increase the quality of your top decks.  
Bear in mind Boros Reckoner and Eternal Scourge are likely the best cards in the mirror alongside cards like Wurmcoil Engine and Batterskull. Reckoner is an excellent threat that cannot be Skred lightly in the late game while Scourge will not die to the removal or most sweepers that Skred Red plays. It is also not terrible to try to bait your opponent into casting a sweeper card with Pia and Kiran Nalaar. Definitely get rid of planeswalkers if you can.

This matchup is liable to be very long and grindy. Whoever sees more cards will likely be the player that wins the match.

For [sideboarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard) you are going to want to cut your worst card first: Blood Moon. Bring in more threats depending on your build. If you play Eternal Scourge, do not board out all of your Relics, since you will need them to exile Scourge in the case that it dies to a Reckoner or something unknown. Molten Rain is useful to destroy a Scrying Sheets or to lower your opponent's snow count. If you have an Outpost Siege, bring it in to beat your opponent with card advantage. Only really look to bring in cards like Dragon's Claw if they are playing an extremely aggressive variant, and you have nothing better to board in.

## GR Scapeshift/Titan Breach
Date: 12/18/2016  
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-titan-shift#online)  
[Primer](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/tier-2-modern/654300-rg-titan-scapeshift) - MTGSalvation  
/r/Scapeshift/  
GR Valakut is an "all in" ramp combo deck built to get six or more mountains and multiple copies of [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=190400) in play as quickly as possible. It is almost certain you are playing against a deck like this if you see any of the following:

  - [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397688)  
  - [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=80250)  
  - [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420781)  
  - [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370526)  
  - [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370563)  
  - [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420766) (normally in color splash builds)  
  - [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=146593)  
  
Now, you would naturally assume this is a decent matchup for us, since their main win condition relies on a nonbasic land, and Blood Moon will shut it off handily. However, this matchup is made difficult by the fact that the opponent can still operate well under a Blood Moon. Because they have the means to find the basic forests they need to cast a [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397688), they can quite easily beat us down with trampling 6/6s. This problem is further complicated, as often they can play this creature before our most powerful (and namesake) removal spell deals enough damage to outright kill it.

Because we very desperately need to stop Valakut itself, our goal is to play Blood Moon in combination with some kind of [threat](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_threats.2Fwin_conditions). They are capable of answering our threats, so it is not bad to have multiples. Post-board, they will likely have an answer to Blood Moon as well, so this is one of seldom few matchups where having multiple Blood Moons is also not bad.  
Watch out for cards like [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370411) (they will not play this if you see an [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407650) or [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397722)) and expect them to play additional creatures like [Obstinate Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=205075) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=378491) to help them clog up the board and either buy time for their combo or just attack regularly.

The deck uses two methods to accelerate their Valakut game plan. One is [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=146593), which they can use to "play" a huge amount of lands all at once by replacing their current lands with lands from their deck, including a copy or two of Valakut. The second method is a combination of [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397688) and [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=80250), where Primeval Titan uses its ability to search for mountains and Valakuts, and Through the Breach allows the Titan to enter the battlefield and attack on the same turn, all before Titan could normally be cast.
  
Here is how Valakut itself works:

  - Mountain enters the battlefield, causing a state based check on Valakut to see if there are five other mountains in play (six mountains total).  
  - If there are five other mountains, Valakut's trigger goes on the stack.  
  - The trigger, upon resolution, will then check again to see if there are still five other mountains in play. If there are, Valakut deals three damage to the legal target.  
  - Multiple Valakuts means double triggers, but still follows this same exact process.  

Now here is the Valakut math that each Valakut player uses before resolving [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=146593):

 - 1 Valakut + 6 mountains is only 18 damage (7 lands)  
 - 2 Valakuts + 6 mountains is 36 damage (8 lands)  
 - 3 Valakuts + 6 mountains is 54 damage (9 lands)  
 - A Scapeshift player will not cast Scapeshift with less than seven lands (searching for the 1 Valakut + 6 mountains)  

Here is the [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=80250) math:

 1. With at least five mountains in play, cast Through the Breach.
 2. Drop a Titan into play. Get two Valakuts from the enters trigger.  
 3. Attack with Primeval Titan. Trigger gets two mountains.  
 4. Mountains trigger the Valakuts twice each for 4x3 damage, so 12 damage.  
 5. Assuming Primeval Titan is not blocked, it will deal another 6 damage, for 18 in total.  
 6. Active Valakuts remain active, so another mountain will deal lethal damage.  

For [sideboarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard), [sweepers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sweepers) should be cut first, as Valakut decks typically never have more than one creature. Eternal Scourge is a card that does not do as much against a deck full of big creatures, so that can also come out in favor of better interaction. Further cuts can be made in Relic of Progenitus, which will only ever cycle in this matchup as Valakut runs no graveyard interaction.

Land destruction directly interferes with their plan and is high priority to sideboard in. Additional threats like Goblin Rabblemaster should come in too, to help close out the game before they put together their strategy. Bring in additional burn spells like Pyrite Spellbomb and Sudden Shock as cards that can help with dealing with Titans. Sudden Shock can also kill a Sakura-Tribe Elder and deny them a land. Torpor Orb and Ensnaring Bridge will slow down Primeval Titan. You can also consider Pithing Needle to name fetchlands or planeswalkers, or Thorn of Amethyst to interfere with their ramp spells and Summoner's Pacts, but those options are only worthwhile when you are on the play as opposed to the draw.  

Overall it is a very close matchup, largely dependent on Blood Moon. I would put it 45/55 in their favor game 1, because it is important to draw the correct interaction against them. It is worse at around 40/60 games 2-3, because they will be able to beat our Blood Moons.

##Tron
###Eldrazi  
Date: 2/18/2018  
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-eldrazi-tron-26966#paper)  
[Primer](https://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/established-modern/big-mana/769015-colorless-eldrazi-tron) - MTGSalvation  
/r/TronMTG/  

Eldrazi Tron is a value-based midrange deck built around the [eldrazi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?type=+[eldrazi]||subtype=+[eldrazi]) creature type from the Zendikar blocks and, to a lesser extent, Eldritch Moon. The deck is made to capitalize on the free mana acceleration provided by [Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=401710). Much like green or blue Tron variants, the deck is additionally capable of assembling the three [Urza lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&type=+[land]&text=+[urza%27s]&name=+[urza%27s]) to further broaden its ability to produce mana earlier than usual. However, contrary to other Tron variants, Eldrazi Tron plays many three-, four-, and five-drop threats that are perfectly playable even when not being accelerated into play. Coupled with a bevy of colorless spells, this variant if Tron is more resilient to Blood Moon that its many nonbasics let on.

Eldrazi Tron's main eldrazi threats are [Matter Reshaper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407516), [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407519), [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407517), and [Endbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407513). Many lists will also opt for a copy or two of [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=402079). Each of these threats are above average in their own way.  
Matter Reshaper is a low-cost threat that replaces itself when it dies. Its three power give it the ability to threaten our life total. Try to hold Anger of the Gods to clear it without giving the opponent the death trigger. A solid play against Eldrazi Tron is to Anger away a Reshaper, then use a Bolt or Skred to finish off a larger threat.  
Thought-Kont Seer is a troublesome card for us. On a decent draw it will come out turn three, and on a very good draw it can be cast off of double Eldrazi temple turn two. The 4/4 body is no joke, dodging Bolt and pressuring our life very quickly in the early game. Spend removal in response to the enters trigger, and prepare to be sad as they Thoughtseize the best card in your hand. Fortunately, late game Thought-Knot is less of a threat. If we already have our threats out, Skred takes care of it with little fuss.  
Reality Smasher beats face, and comes with a frustrating protection effect as well. Be prepared to answer this one with Skred, Roast, or Dismember, and keep a land or otherwise to pitch to the effect. An unanswered Smasher will end the game very quickly.  
Endbringer is quite a bit slower than Smasher and less resilient to removal, too. However, it will swing games where it goes unanswered much more fiercely, as it is very difficult to compete with its dual offense/defense style.

Being a colorless deck, Eldrazi tron also runs several artifacts and other colorless spells to fill gaps in its strategy. [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=425804) is a major axis of interaction, generally played on one to stop our Bolts and Skreds. [Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=423848) also makes an appearance, though we are mostly resilient against the interaction it outputs until the very late game. [[Dismember]] kills most things at a great rate in exchange for life, making it a very strong removal spell against our top end threats. [[All is Dust]] is a one-sided sweeper that can be played with Temple mana, and is generally a backbreaking two- or three-for-one. [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397828) is not a fast threat like it is in green Tron variants, but it still removes our best permanent and threatens to run away with the game. Mana denial and an aggressive game plan are key to preventing these seven-mana cards from stealing the game.

Though this is a difficult matchup at a glance, there are ways Skred Red can pull ahead. Blood Moon is still good, despite its less crucial role, as it will cut off the mana acceleration from Temples. Once under a Blood Moon, there are limited ways for Eldrazi Tron to cast its eldrazi creatures. Four [Mind Stones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438785) and two [Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407693) (which can be found using one of their [Expedition Maps](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397742)) will allow them to create colorless mana through Moon, so it can often be correct to target these sources with artifact/land destruction. These forms of removal come in hand in other situations as well, such as keeping them off Urza lands, blocking their access to Karn or All is Dust, and removing troublesome artifacts like Chalice, [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370623), or [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=425815). Bigger [removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_utility) from Skred's sideboard like Dismember or Roast can also help swing the match, as ease in removing Eldrazi Tron's small-to-medium threats will make the fight much simpler.

In addition, Eldrazi Tron suffers from some inconsistencies not having access to many forms of card filtering or draw. Their nut draws are nigh unbeatable, but given the right interaction Skred Red can tussle with the threats the deck puts out, even if they are a little bigger and scarier than ours. This puts the matchup somewhere around 45/55 or even 50/50 at best.

### Gx
Date: 12/17/2016  
[Stock List](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-tron-16063#online)  
[Primer](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/tier-2-modern/220174-gr-and-gx-tron) - MTGSalvation  
/r/TronMTG/
Tron is a ramp deck made to abuse the trio of [Urza lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&type=+[land]&text=+[urza%27s]&name=+[urza%27s]) to cast seven-mana spells on turn 3. They run several tutors to find these lands and assemble the trio as quickly as possible. They also run eight [Chromatic artifacts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&cmc=+=[1]&name=+[chromatic]&type=+[%22Artifact%22]) to cycle through their deck and fix their mana. Once they have assembled the Urza "tron", they can cast several huge colorless spells to bury the opponent:

  - [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397828)
  - [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=389756)
  - [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247338)
  - [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394086)
  - [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407636)
  - [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=402079)

Because the deck relies so heavily on nonbasic lands in order to cast its huge spells, it may come as no surprise that Blood Moon is Skred's best game 1 card in this matchup. However, Blood Moon alone will not beat Tron. Skred Red does not kill its opponent in a hurry, and as such it can still fall victim to Tron if it does not apply enough pressure to win before Tron reaches six or seven lands and begins casting its spells regularly (Tron will very rarely miss a land drop as well, due to its cycling and tutors). Also, should Tron draw Oblivion Stone against Skred, there is little Skred can do game 1 to win, as Stone will take care of Blood Moon and any board presence Skred has built, after which Tron can start playing Karns and Wurmcoils that Skred realistically will have an incredibly hard time beating. Furthermore, Tron might just assemble the Urza lands turn 3 on the play and cast a Karn Liberated before we even reach three mana to cast Blood Moon. Add to these the fact that much of Skred Red's sweepers and removal are useless against Tron's humongous threats, and it may come as no surprise that Tron is one of Skred Red's worst matchups. Skred Red pilots intending on beating Tron must come very well prepared.

As previously stated, game 1 will be terrible for the Skred player. The best interaction is Blood Moon, so prioritize finding it. Tron does not run any important graveyard interactions (they will rarely need to recur World Breaker against us), so freely use Relic of Progenitus to dig deeper in the deck to find Moon. Similarly, Pyrite Spellbombs and Magma Jets have no meaningful targets, so use these to dig as well. Otherwise, all Skred can do is apply pressure with its threats and hope Tron is slow to get going.

Tron's threats can be answered. Anger of the Gods can team up with a Boros Reckoner or removal spell to kill a Wurmcoil Engine without triggering its death ability. Karn Liberated will routinely exile a permanent as soon as it comes down, so Lightning Bolt can finish it off. Koth or other hasty creatures can come down and finish off a planeswalker, assuming the opponent does not have a World Breaker. Unfortunately, answering one of Tron's threats is not often enough, but sometimes they will draw poor, threat-light hands.

It is also good to note that, under a Blood Moon, Koth can animate the opponent's lands into 4/4s, which can be killed with removal to keep Tron at a low land count.

Games 2 and 3 are where the real battle begins. The matchup will often still be lopsided in Trons favor, especially when Tron is on the play, but Skred Red can bring in several pieces of [interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard) to try and stop Tron from getting off the ground.

The primary Tron killer is land destruction. Keeping Tron as far away from seven, six, or even five mana is the primary way Skred Red aims to beat Tron. Molten Rain is the fastest land destruction spell in mono-red, coming down on turn 3. Crumble to Dust and its predecessor Sowing Salt are slower, but they will completely remove the possibility of Tron assembling the Urza lands on top of dropping their mana resources. Artifact destruction like Vandalblast and Shattering Spree can destroy an [Expedition Map](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397742) on turn 1, before the Tron player has a chance to activate it and search out an Urzatron land. Artifact destruction can also be used to protect your board from an Oblivion Stone. Pithing Needle can be used in the same way as artifact destruction, and can also shut down a Karn or Ugin. Goblin Rabblemaster will aid in applying pressure, and Surgical Extraction can combine with Molten Rain to create a makeshift Crumble to Dust (you need a full four Molten Rain for this plan to be likely, however). If you are really hurting for interaction, Chalice of the Void on one stops Tron from using Chromatic artifacts, Expedition Maps, and [Ancient Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=193437) to cycle through their deck and find answers to Blood Moon.

For cuts, sweepers and creatures-only removal like Anger of the Gods and Skred can come out (Lightning Bolts apply pressure, so they stay in), as well as anything else that does not dig, apply pressure, or affect Tron's game plan. Digging cards like Relic are the weakest link of these necessities, so if you have more interaction or pressure, draw from that pool.

This matchup is extremely unfavorable. Pre-side our chances are 20/80, favoring Tron heavily. Post-side, the chances get better with enough land destruction, and it may be 45/55 - still unfavorable, but much improved.

###Mono Blue

Mono Blue Tron (or UTron) is a "draw-go" style control deck that relies on counterspells to stall out the game until they assemble the [three "UrzaTron" lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&type=+%5Bland%5D&text=+%5Burza%27s%5D&name=+%5Burza%27s%5D) to cast powerful win conditions.  

Common win conditions:  

 - [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394086)
 - [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=416971)
 - [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=212631)
 - [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=207875)
 - [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209044)
 - [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407519)

The control package is fairly straightforward too:  

 - [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=393823)
 - [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397881)
 - [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=405357)
 - [Spatial Contortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407518)
 - [Spell Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=109707) (this can also function as a win condition by itself to lock opponents out of the game)
 - [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=34901)

The matchup is pretty rough in every phase of the game. Much like Gx Tron we are forced to play the role of the aggressive deck. The big issue a Skred deck has against UTron is the high amount of counter magic the deck runs, as it plays both [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=393823) and [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397881) as four-ofs, which can make it difficult to make headway on board development. Blood Moon, while good at stopping the tron lands, does little against their basic Islands, and the UTron player can [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=405357) Blood Moon when the time comes for them to play a big threat.  

Since they are mono blue, they can have difficulty dealing with a resolved permanent in the early game, and most lists only play 2-3 Repeals and [Spatial Contortions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407518) in the main deck as the primary source of removal. In the late game they have access to powerful sweepers like [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394086) and [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=34901), which should be avoided at all cost.

UTron's strongest win condition against us is the "[Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209044) lock". It is very slow getting off the ground, but if the UTron player has access to twelve mana (only one of which must be Blue) and an [Academy Ruins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370424) they can play, activate, and Academy Ruins the [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209044) to take control of your next turn for the rest of the game.  

In [sideboarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkredRed/wiki/index#wiki_sideboard), it is not a terrible idea to have access to artifact removal since a majority of the win conditions a UTron player plays are artifacts. An effect like Pithing Needle is effective naming Ugin, Oblivion Stone, or Mindslaver. Land destruction can take them off of tron lands, an setting them back in mana makes it much easier to play around their countermagic. Additional threats like Goblin Rabblemaster should definitely be considered as well. Since counter magic is their primary form of interaction, it is nice to have access to Ricochet Trap or Reverberate to either force through a spell or answer a Spell Burst (which can be done in two ways depending on your choice. Ricochet Trap will fizzle Spell Burst if you redirect the Spell Burst to the Trap, but this can only be done if Spell Burst is countering one of your four-drops. Reverberate can fizzle Spell Burst by copying Spell Burst in order to counter your own spell, which will fizzle their Spell Burst at the cost of two cards).

For cuts, trim removal with Thought-Kont Seer in mind. Sweepers are completely dead. Spells that do not play a long game well such as Boros Reckoner can be swapped for more long-game-focused answers and threats. Relics should stay in, since a lot of UTron lists not only have Academy Ruins, but sometimes a one- or two-of of [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=425875). Furthermore, Eternal Scourge is a good recurrable threat against control decks like this.

As mentioned, this is a bad matchup for almost any Skred Red deck, especially if the UTron player is well-practiced with the deck. Consider it to range between 20/80 to 40/60, depending mostly on the UTron player's skill level. Luckily, Mono Blue Tron is a fringe deck that is often seen as a budget path to building other Tron variants, and it has infinitely more complex lines of play than we do. That said, it has it's lovers and an experienced UTron player will probably win the match most times.
